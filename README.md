# System Scripts

My collection of bash python and perl (when and if I get round to learning it) scripts to make things easy.

### AWS

* Connect to an AWS instance using a private key

### Ruby / RVM

* Install RVM and set up a number of basic instances with some templated gemsets
* Fix the "bash --login" problem with RVM
